A project was undertaken to enhance question matching and duplicate detection using **Natural Language
Processing (NLP)** techniques and **Machine Learning algorithms**. **Random Forest** and **XGBoost models**
were effectively applied to classify question pairs as duplicates or not, significantly improving user experience.
â—¦ The project involved managing and Data Cleaning large-scale datasets, applying **NLP Preprocessing
Techniques** such as **TF-IDF** and **Feature Engineering** and optimizing model performance to achieve optimal
performance for duplicate question identification. Conducted in-depth model analysis, hyperparameter tuning,
which helped in refining Machine Learning algorithms.
